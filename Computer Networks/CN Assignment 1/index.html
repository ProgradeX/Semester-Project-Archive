                <h5>By Username - Dated: 15th march 2023</h5>
                <p>
                    REMEMBER WHEN MYSPACE suffered one of the largest user data breaches ever? 
                    Around 360 million accounts were compromised in June 2013, 
                    but Myspace said in 2016 when it disclosed the incident that it was taking action 
                    to shore up its security. Which would be great, except that 
                    it turns out anyone could have taken over any Myspace account 
                    if they had the account owner’s listed name, 
                    username, and date of birth. Whoops!
                </p>
                <h2 id="thehack">The Hack</h2>
                <p>
                    LeakedSource reported that the MySpace passwords were stored in SHA1 with no salting, 
                    a process that makes decrypting passwords exponentially harder. MySpace confirmed the stolen data included 
                    user login data "from a portion of accounts that were created prior to June 11, 2013." <br><br>

                    The data is several years old, however. It appears to be limited to a portion of the 
                    overall user base from the old Myspace platform (prior to June 11), at which point the 
                    site was relaunched with added security. <br><br>
                    
                    Time, Inc. didn’t confirm how many user accounts were included in this data set, but a report from 
                    LeakedSource.com says that there are over 360 million accounts involved. Each record contains an email 
                    address, a password, and in some cases, a second password. As some accounts have multiple passwords, 
                    that means there are over 427 million total passwords available for sale. <br><br>
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="./Images/hak.jpg" height="320" alt="MyspaceView" class="image">
                </div>
                <h2 id="hacksize">Size of the breach</h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the fact that this data breach dates back several years, the size of the data set in question 
                    makes it notable. Security researchers at Sophos say that this could be the largest data breach of all 
                    time, easily topping the whopping 117 million LinkedIn emails and passwords that recently surfaced online 
                    from a 2012 hack. <br><br>
                    
                    That estimation seems to hold up – while there are a number of other large-scale data breaches, even some of 
                    the biggest were not of this size. The U.S. voter database breach included 191 million records, Anthem’s 
                    was 80 million, eBay was 145 million, Target was 70 million, Experian 200 million, Heartland 130 million, 
                    and so on. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h2 id="sitestate">The State of the site</h2>
                <p>
                    
                    The issue with these older data breaches is that they’re from an era where security measures were not as 
                    strong as today. That means these passwords are easily cracked. LeakedSource notes that the top 50 passwords 
                    from those cracked account for over 6 million passwords – or 1.5 percent of the total, to give 
                    you a sense of scale. <br><br>
                    
                    That allowed Time, Inc. to date the data breach to some extent, as the site was relaunched in June 
                    2013 with strengthened account security, including double-salted hashes to store passwords. It also 
                    confirmed that the breach has no effect on any of its other systems, subscriber information, or 
                    other media properties, nor did the leaked data include any financial information. <br><br>
                    
                    Myspace is notifying users and has already invalidated the passwords of known affected accounts.
                    Security researcher Leigh-Anne Galloway notified Myspace about the flaw in April, 
                    and published details about it on Monday after failing to receive a substantive response. <br><br>
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="./Images/myspace-account-recovery.webp" height="320" alt="MyspaceView" class="image">
                </div>
                <p>    
                    Galloway discovered that the Account Recovery form doesn't actually require very much information
                    to validate ownership of an account and take control of it. Since the name and username associated 
                    with an account show up on its public profile, Myspace’s account recovery setup was such that you 
                    really only needed someone’s date of birth to complete an account takeover. The form claimed that 
                    other fields like the account email address were "required," but it wasn't actually validating these 
                    fields in practice. <br><br>
