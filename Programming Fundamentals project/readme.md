## Usage
This program is a prime example of structures and functions combined with arrays. The first part involves a structure which has the ability to store user name, password and balance.

When the main program is initialized, it provides the user with a few options, to either create an account, log-in to withdraw and deposit, view all accounts, and an option to end program.

Firstly you need to create an account because the database has no account information. Pressing 1 will prompt you to account creation menu.

The program will save all your information in a structure, and provide an account number automatically based on the number of free slots available. You can press any key to confirm your details and return to main menu.
When you are in the main menu, you can choose any option to either create another account, view accounts in a table format, or to Log-in to an account. For now we can press 2 to log-in.

In this scenario I put the wrong password and the program does not allow me to edit my balance. Letâ€™s press 1 and try the correct password this time.

After successful authentication, the user has been provided with a few options to either deposit or withdraw from their balance, or to return to the main screen. For now we should deposit a few rupees into the account by pressing 1.

It will add or subtract balance based on your choices, and when the changes are made the program will let the user see their new balance until they press any key, from which you are returned back to the main menu.
(The withdraw and deposit features are nearly identical in their functionality)

Pressing the 3 key will allow you to see the accounts in a tabular format. I have created a few example accounts for viewing purposes (Passwords are not shown).
Those are all the features, Lets press 4 in the main menu to close the program.
